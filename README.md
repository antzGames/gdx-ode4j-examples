# ode4j experimental version on GWT libGDX

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10563814/233501942-d7043084-1781-4413-bcf3-16b595506bb9.mp4

This repository hosts an experimental version of Open Dynamics Engine for Java (ode4j) 3D physics library working on libGDX's GWT backend.  Use at your own risk.  Because a lot of the original ode4j code was modified to compile and run properly on libGDX's GWT backend, I cannot guarantee everything is working properly.  More importantly keeping up to date with ode4j updates will be difficult.

If you want to use ode4j only on libGDX Desktop/Android/iOS backends then I recommend you use [odej4](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j) directly.  However if you want cross platform support (i.e include GWT support) then you could use this library for all platforms.

I created this repository to play with a 3D physics engine that works on libGDX's GWT backend for game JAMS and other fun stuff.  I do not recommend to use in important projects.

### What I changed from ode4j's codebase

Here is a brief summary of what I had to change to get ode4j to work on libGDX's backend:

I also removed most of the cpp (C++) packages and classes.

## Where to get ODE documentation and help

ODE official manual: http://ode.org/wiki/index.php/Manual

ode4j discord channel : https://discord.gg/UFXJcXv2P8 ode4j/Java

ode4j contains also some features that are not present in ODE, such as a ragdoll and heightfields with holes. See ode4j's [Wiki](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/wiki/Functionality-beyond-ODE).

The [ODE forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ode-users) is useful for questions around physics and general API usage.

The [ode4j forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ode4j) is for problems and functionality specific to ode4j/Java. 

There is also the [old website](https://tzaeschke.github.io/ode4j-old/), including some [screenshots](https://tzaeschke.github.io/ode4j-old/ode4j-features.html).

## What you don't get

This is a 3D physics library only.  You will have to implement your own draw calls.  ode4j demos use an unoptimized custom drawing helper classes based on LWJGL.  Even ode4j's documentation says that thier render implementation has poor performance and is not optimized.  Regardless, there was no point migrating the drawing helper classes over because we use libGDX.

Becasue I did not migrate the draw helper classes, every demo from ode4j will not work.

## Some headaches

ODE has its own math classes such similar to libGDX's Vector3, Matrix3, and Quaternion.  You will have to get to know them and learn how to covert ODE's versions to libGDX's version when writing your game.  In addition ODE uses double and not float as most of libGDX's math classes use.

## Demo

My demo is a modified version of the [DemoCrash](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/org/ode4j/demo/DemoCrash.java) in ode4j demo package.  This demo is shown on the video at the top of this page.

It currently creates 75 boxes and I get 60 frame per second (fps) on a Chrome based browser.  You can increase the size of the wall, resulting in more boxes by modifying these two constants:

```java
    private static final float WALLWIDTH = 12;		// width of wall
    private static final float WALLHEIGHT = 10;		// height of wall
```

For me if when I generate over 200 boxes my fps goes down significantly.  To experiment for yourself, modify the [DemoCrashScreen](https://github.com/antzGames/ode4j-GTW-Compatible-libGDX/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/antz/ode4libGDX/screens/DemoCrashScreen.java).

I plan to convert more ode4j demos over to libGDX rendering.  Stay tuned.

## Repo structure

A [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/tommyettinger/gdx-liftoff).

This project was generated with a template including simple application launchers and a main class extending `Game` that sets the first screen.

My modified ode4j [source code](https://github.com/antzGames/ode4j-GTW-Compatible-libGDX/tree/master/core/src/main/java/org/ode4j) is included in this repo.  Currently no work has been done to make and publish this as a library.  Still to experiemental for that.

## Platforms

- `core`: Main module with the application logic shared by all platforms.
- `lwjgl3`: Primary desktop platform using LWJGL3.
- `android`: Android mobile platform. Needs Android SDK.
- `html`: Web platform using GWT and WebGL. Supports only Java projects.
